# Mini-JSfiddle
JSfiddle in under 1k with localStorage

Online Code Editor that enabled editing HTML, CSS, and JS in browser and shows a live preview. It uses localStorage to store or cache your code and it includes buttons to view the full source code, view the preview in full screen, and download the file.

Inspired by [miniCodeEditor](http://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/)

Submitted to the [2014 JS1k Competition](http://js1k.com/2014-dragons/) and won 4th place.
